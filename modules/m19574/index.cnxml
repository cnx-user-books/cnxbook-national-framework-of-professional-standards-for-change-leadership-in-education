If the standards are to respond to the serious need for highly trained and competent change leaders in education, then state departments of education should develop a professional license (or certificate) for change leadership based on the standards. Then schools and colleges of education could use the standards to design graduate-level programs of study focusing on change leadership in education. Below, you will find an idealized mission, vision, and design for an innovative graduate-level program for preparing change leaders in education. </para></section>

Envision faculty training teams of district-based change leaders about how to create and sustain systemic transformational change in their districts. Imagine that this training not only teaches these educators how to create and sustain transformational change, but actually expects them to go back to their districts to apply what they learn. Imagine faculty in the department providing coaching and technical assistance to those change leaders as they plan and implement a transformational change methodology. 
</para><para id="eip-826">Imagine the benefit to the school districts, the children they serve, and the educators working in those districts as the participating teams of change leaders begin applying cutting-edge principles for transforming their districts to enhance the quality of student, teacher, and system learning.

Not everyone is cut out for change leadership. This challenging responsibility requires a special breed of leader with identifiable traits (see Duffy and Reigeluth’s traits earlier in this chapter). Some of these traits are trainable, but others, like personality, are not. People either have those non-trainable traits, or they don’t. </item></list>The disposition for change leadership should be a trait of the team applying for admission rather than traits held by each individual on the team. The disposition for change leadership can be assessed by surveying the attitudes of each member of a team applying for admission and then calculating a team profile. If the profile indicates that the team, as a whole, has a disposition for change leadership then that team may be considered for admission to the Institute. During Summer 1 some of the learning activities will focus on refining and enhancing the team’s disposition for change leadership. If individual members enter the Institute without a clearly defined disposition for change leadership these learning activities will aim to help reshape their pre-dispositions.</entry>

    <section id="eip-532"><title>Conclusion</title>


    <para id="id19288036"> I believe there is a striking need for effective change leadership in America’s school systems. This need is not being responded to by state departments of education or graduate-level education leadership programs. Further, I believe that an effective and proactive response to this need is for state departments of education to adopt research-based standards to develop a professional license for change leaders in education and for schools and colleges of education to design a graduate-level program specializing in preparing change leaders about the why, what, and how of creating and sustaining systemic transformational change in school districts. </para>
    <para id="id19032367"> If America’s school systems are to be transformed to meet the demands of the Information Age, then they will need effective change leadership. Responding to this need will require courage, passion, and vision from state department of education leaders and university faculty if they are to do what’s required to adopt a framework for preparing change leaders. </para>
    <para id="id22277626"> Some readers of this article will say, “Impossible, can’t be done!” Call me a dreamer, a believer in the impossible becoming possible, but I think that once the proposed standards are validated they can be applied to create a cadre of knowledgeable and highly skilled change leaders in education. I believe that university faculty who also have personal courage, passion, and vision can design and operate an institute like the one described in this article. Finally, in the words of Kris Kruger (a singer and songwriter), “…when we seek the unseekable, when we speak the unspeakable, when we think the unthinkable, when we achieve the unachievable, the impossible is possible.”
